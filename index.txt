p71 - reduced fraction, farey prior
p72 - reduced fractions, totient, distinct factors, farey_sum
p73 - reduced fractions, farey prior (brute force), farey next
p74 - factorial chains. longest chain with n < 1000000 is 60. find all 60s.
p75 - count number of pytagorean triples that have only 1 perimeter
      Triples generated by a=n^2 - m^2; b = 2nm; c=n^2+m^2 for integer n,m.
      If n-m is odd and n,m are coprimes, then only primitive triples generated.
p76 - integer partition - see p78 number of combinations of ints that add up to 100
p77 - partition with sum of primes - like 76,78
p78 - integer partition - euler generator function - pentogonal numbers
p79 - worked out by hand
p80 - sqr roots - used convergents of continued fractions of sqr roots
p81 - minimal path through matrix
p82 - harder 81
p83 - hardest 81
